	## Task Goal
        Generate the fewest number of entries possible to give a clear overview of the features and fixes introduced between releases.

	## Processing Rules

        ### Classification & Merging

        1. Extraction: Read the commit messages located at the .commits JQ path.
        2. Classification: Classify every resulting entry strictly as either a `feat` or a `fix`.
        3. Semantic Merging: Merge/summarize two or more commits if they are semantically identical or redundant
        (e.g. "fix deployment" and "deployment is now working" should be merged into one entry).
        4. ID Generation: If an entry represents a single, unmerged commit, retain its original ID/commit hash.
          - If you merge or summarize two or more commits together, generate a unique UUID v4 for that new entry.

        ### Restrictions

        - Never merge a feat and a fix together.
	- Never merge commits with different scopes (e.g. `feat(harvey)` and `feat(mcp)` must remain separate).
        - Never generate more output entries that the total number of commits provided in the input.
